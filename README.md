# Project 3: Celebrate Care

## Description

More and more American families are faced with the emotional journey of caring for their elderly loved ones. Often this causes stress, denial, anxiety, and family drama because of how we view “care”. We treat “caring for loved ones” as an obligation. This task becomes a chore that we schedule and block out as something on our essential to-do-list.

At Celebrate Care our mission is to help our users celebrate the important people in their lives. We encourage you to dream big with your loved ones and create lifelong memories. Let your other apps schedule medical appointments and take care of logistics. Celebrate Care is about celebrating the ones we care for, because this is Care worth celebrating!

## User Story

### _Care is not a burden..._

Alison and her husband were the only ones of the grandkids visiting grandma Phylis. At 84 years old, Alison’s grandmother Phylis had always had a fun, sugary personality that was only matched by her delicious cookies she made for her grandkids. But after arriving at the nursing home, Phylis’ grandkids found it hard to see grandma “this way” and often ignored Alison’s request to plan a visit together.

Phylis’ story is the story of a growing elderly population of Americans. Often this is because of the way we view the term: care. Care is seen as a way to make someone comfortable during their final days. It causes discomfort, mourning, anxiety, and, oftentimes, family drama because no one wants to see grandma “like this”.

That's where Celebrate Care comes in.
